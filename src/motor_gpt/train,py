"""
train.py (Torch env)

Training entry point for Motor-GPT:
- loads processed episodes (`data/processed/*.pt`)
- builds DataLoaders via ActionSequenceDataset
- trains Motor-GPT with standard optimizer + eval loop
- saves checkpoints/logs under `runs/`

Designed to stay simple; expand only when needed (schedulers, wandb, etc.).
